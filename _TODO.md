### Per chat "mini-apps"
- [ ] A pet/s, that the members of the chat are taking care of (Tamagochi-like)
        - The members are just like a parents of the pet
        - Every member has its own "home" that the pet can be in
            at a time
        - The pet can "travel" between "homes" (members) of the chat
            OR between other people`s chats for "holidays" or as "babysitting"
        - The pet has multiple needs like hunger, thirst, energy/fun, toilet-needs,
            playing, etc. (just like in the game Pou)
            - There could be mini-games (like in Pou) that will increase
                the pets "fun need" and decrease its "energy" for example
